                the Imagine U program is an entrepreneural accelerator at the Crew's Center For Entrepreneurship at the University of Memphis. It consists of a summer long venture where you learn the ins and outs of starting a business. This program taught me the core fundamentals of entrepreneurship and launched my interest in starting my own business.
